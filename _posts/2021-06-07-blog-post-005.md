Check out my interview on AMS's [Clear Skies Ahead podcast](https://www.ametsoc.org/index.cfm/ams/education-careers/careers/career-guides-tools/all-about-careers-in-meteorology/clear-skies-ahead-podcast/), where I talk about my experience as an oceanographic researcher at Scripps and interviewing/onboarding for a new job during the pandemic. 

Describing my background and career choices in the interview, I realized that it has been a winding path into BOEM. During much of that time, I didn't have clear medium- to long-term career goals, as I was focused on studying cool problems in the short-term. I wouldn't necessarily recommend this "go with the flow" career approach to others, but it has worked out for me so far, and I have been fortunate to live in nice places like Hawaii and San Diego.

Bonus points to the podcast hosts, Kelly Savoie and Rex Horner, for asking me about [MIT football](https://www.mitathletics.com/sports/m-footbl/index).
