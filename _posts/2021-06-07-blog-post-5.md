Check out my interview on AMS's [Clear Skies Ahead podcast](https://www.ametsoc.org/index.cfm/ams/education-careers/careers/career-guides-tools/all-about-careers-in-meteorology/clear-skies-ahead-podcast/) (released March 23), where I talk about my experience as an oceanograhpic researcher at Scripps and interviewing/onboarding for a new job during the pandemic. 

It is flattering when people show so much interest in your life experience and opinions. Bonus points to the hosts, Kelly Savoie and Rex Horner, for asking me about juggling football and academics at MIT.
