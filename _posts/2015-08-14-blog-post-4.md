Check out my interview on AMS's [Clear Skies Ahead podcast](https://www.ametsoc.org/index.cfm/ams/education-careers/careers/career-guides-tools/all-about-careers-in-meteorology/clear-skies-ahead-podcast/) (released March 23), where I talk about my experience as an oceanograhpic researcher at Scripps and interviewing/onboarding for a new job during the pandemic. The hosts, Kelly Savoie and Rex Horner, were terrific and even asked me about juggling academics and football at MIT.
