Hi! I am an ocean and atmospheric scientist at the [Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM)](https://www.boem.gov) headquarters in Virginia, part of the [U.S. Department of the Interior](https://www.doi.gov). Prior to that I was a postdoc and project scientist at the [Scripps Institution of Oceanography](https://scripps.ucsd.edu), U.C. San Diego.

At Scripps I studied regional-scale atmosphere-ocean interactions, which have a strong influence on the climate variability that is felt by communities, including the impacts of climate change. I was advised by Prof. [Shang-Ping Xie](https://sxie.scrippsprofiles.ucsd.edu/), with funding from the [NASA physical oceanography program](https://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/oceanography/physical-ocean). I worked heavily with satellite observations of oceanic variables such as [sea surface temperature](http://www.remss.com/measurements/sea-surface-temperature/), [sea level](https://sealevel.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/), and [ocean color](https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/); and atmospheric variables such as [surface winds](https://winds.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/quikscat/), rainfall, and clouds. We supplemented satellite data where appropriate with in situ observations from buoys, ships, and gliders.

I run computer simulations with the [Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)](https://github.com/wrf-model) model and [Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS)](https://www.myroms.org/), and utilize gridded reanalyses such as [ERA5](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5) and [NCEP](https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/climate-data/ncep-reanalysis-r2). I have found that combining satellite observations with numerical modeling is a powerful approach for developing robust explanations about processes in our environment. 

Specific problems I worked on at Scripps include:
* orographic wind forcing of ocean circulation and upwelling in the Southern California Bight
* coupling between surface winds and rainfall
* satellite wind retrieval errors near coastal mountains

Check out my [publications](publications/) and [research highlights](research/) for more information.

I am interested in the application of machine learning and artificial intelligence methods in earth science, and have worked with [Will Chapman](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=C1ox2CEAAAAJ) at Scripps to utilize convolutional neural networks (deep learning) for the improvement of satellite wind retrievals.

I received a Ph.D. in physical oceanography from the [University of Hawaii](http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/oceanography/index.html) in 2013, working on air-sea interaction around SST fronts; and a S.B. in mathematics from [MIT](https://math.mit.edu/index.php) in 2006. 


At BOEM
------
At the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), I work in the Office of Environmental Programs at headquarters. We manage scientific studies on the outer continental shelf that help to ensure offshore energy resources (oil, gas, wind, tidal, etc.) are utilized responsibly. My responsibilities include studies related to physical oceanography and coastal winds (e.g., air quality). 


AMS Air-Sea Interaction Committee
------
From 2017--2021, I served on the American Meteorological Society Air-Sea Interaction Committee. As part of this responsibility, I helped organize the [Air-Sea Interaction Conference](https://annual.ametsoc.org/index.cfm/2021/program-events/conferences-and-symposia/22nd-conference-on-air-sea-interaction/) at the [2021 AMS Annual Meeting](https://annual.ametsoc.org/index.cfm/2021/). 


Other interests
------
I love spending time outdoors (beaches, hiking, etc.) and indulging my passion for college football. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or just want to say hello (tomk at alum.mit.edu).
