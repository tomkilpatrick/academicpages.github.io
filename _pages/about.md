Hi! I recently started working as an oceanographer at the [Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM)](https://www.boem.gov) headquarters in Virginia, part of the [U.S. Department of the Interior](https://www.doi.gov). Prior to that I was a postdoc and project scientist at the [Scripps Institution of Oceanography](https://scripps.ucsd.edu), U.C. San Diego.

At Scripps I studied regional-scale atmosphere-ocean interactions, which have a strong influence on the climate variability that is felt by communities, including the impacts of climate change. I was advised by Prof. [Shang-Ping Xie](https://sxie.scrippsprofiles.ucsd.edu/), with funding from the [NASA physical oceanography program](https://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/oceanography/physical-ocean). I worked heavily with satellite observations of oceanic variables such as [sea surface temperature](http://www.remss.com/measurements/sea-surface-temperature/), [sea level](https://sealevel.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/), and [ocean color](https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/); and atmospheric variables such as [surface winds](https://winds.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/quikscat/), rainfall, and clouds. We supplemented satellite data where appropriate with in situ observations from buoys, ships, and gliders.

I run computer simulations with the [Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)](https://github.com/wrf-model) model and [Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS)](https://www.myroms.org/), and utilize gridded reanalyses such as [ERA5](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5) and [NCEP](https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/climate-data/ncep-reanalysis-r2). I have found that combining satellite observations with numerical modeling is a powerful approach for developing robust explanations about processes in our environment. 

Specific problems I worked on at Scripps include:
* orographic wind forcing of ocean circulation and upwelling in the Southern California Bight
* coupling between surface winds and rainfall
* satellite wind retrieval errors near coastal mountains

Check out my [publications](publications/) for more information.

I am interested in the application of machine learning and artificial intelligence methods in earth science, and have worked with [Will Chapman](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=C1ox2CEAAAAJ) at Scripps to utilize convolutional neural networks (deep learning) for the improvement of satellite wind retrievals.

I received a Ph.D. in physical oceanography from the [University of Hawaii](http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/oceanography/index.html) in 2013, working on air-sea interaction around SST fronts; and a S.B. in mathematics from [MIT](https://math.mit.edu/index.php) in 2006. 


AMS Air-Sea Interaction Committee
------
Since 2017, I have served on the American Meteorological Society Air-Sea Interaction Committee. As part of this responsibility, I am helping organize the [Air-Sea Interaction Conference](https://annual.ametsoc.org/index.cfm/2021/program-events/conferences-and-symposia/22nd-conference-on-air-sea-interaction/) at the upcoming [AMS Annual Meeting](https://annual.ametsoc.org/index.cfm/2021/), which will be held in virtual format January 10-14, 2021. Hope to see you there!


At BOEM
------
At the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), I am working in the Division of Environmental Sciences. We oversee scientific research on the outer continental shelf that is relevant to energy production (oil, gas, wind, tidal, etc.). I am just getting started at BOEM and will try to post some information about my projects soon.


Other interests
------
I love spending time outdoors (beaches, hiking, etc.) and indulging my passion for college football. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or just want to say hello (tomk at alum.mit.edu).
